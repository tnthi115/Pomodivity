 Our website is based around a new method aimed at increasing productivity for those who struggle without the presence of concrete goals. Developed by Francesco Cirillo, the Pomodoro Technique revolves around a timer that can be adjusted to create customized time intervals to boost productivity. Made for periods of uncertainty, this website ensures that a path to accomplishment is always available.

    Procedure:
        1) Add tasks to be completed on the To-Do List.
        2) Choose the amount of time you would like to spend working during each interval.
        3) Complete the tasks and then check them off as you go.
        4) Enjoy your breaks!

Working without proper planning can be daunting, so let us help keep you on track.
